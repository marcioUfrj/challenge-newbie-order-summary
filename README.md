## My process

1. I started looking carefully the project design to figure out the basic HTML structure.
2. I coded the complete HTML code with my first observations.
3. I added the fonts and crated the .css file.
4. I coded the first variables I'd use from the style-guide.md: font-size, font-weights and colors
5. I added the background color and top figure.
6. I added the Title, Description, Payment/Cancel buttons
7. I added the top figure
8. I added the section with music icon, plan type, plan value and change button
9. I added the flexbox to organize the divs for each section.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Hover
- Background images

### Continued development

What's left to be done:
  - I need to fix the body container position.
  - I need to finish the mobile version.

What I want to improve:
  - flexbox
  - my skills with more complex layouts.

### Useful resources
